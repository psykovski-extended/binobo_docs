\begin{abstract}
    In recent years, developments such as robotic prosthetics, personal 3D-animation software and virtual reality have created demand for an affordable motion capture system. 
    Since professional equipment is sold at professional prices, Binobo aims to offer a cheap alternative by using commonly available hardware in conjunction with open-source software on order to provide a way to capture all degrees of freedom the human hand has to offer.
    Our project is based on previous homemade mechanical arm control systems and VR-controllers created by people all around the world, as well as rigorous iterative testing.
    This project proves that it is possible to develop an open-source alternative to expensive mocap systems on the small, yet complicated scale a hand requires.
